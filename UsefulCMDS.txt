[PowerShell]
	<!IMPORTANT!> Powershell pipes objects instead of text in bash
	The powershell version of 'xargs' usage in bash 
		"cat refs/heads/master | xargs git cat-file -p" 
		is
		"cat .\refs\heads\master | %{git cat-file -p $_}" 
		$_ stands for the piped variable
	"Invoke-Item" or "ii" 
		Invoke the (provider-specific) default action on an item (like a START command or double click.) This will force the default action to be run on the item. For example a .PDF file will open in whatever program is associated with PDF files.
		Examples:
		Opens a file in Microsoft Word:
		PS C:\> invoke-item C:\finances.doc
		Open multiple Excel spreadsheets at once by using a wildcard:
		PS C:\> invoke-item "F:\My Documents\*.xls"
[Git Powershell]
	$git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
		Show commit log graph of current history
	$git branch -u <upstream> [<branchname>]
		Set up <branchname>'s tracking information so <upstream> is considered <branchname>'s upstream branch. If no <branchname> is specified, then it defaults to the current branch. <upstream> means origin/<branchname>
	The color of branch name
		If the branch name is BLUE, it means the branch is up-to-date with '<upstream>'
		If the branch name is GREEN, it means the branch has commit ahead of '<upstream>'
		If the branch name is YELLOW, it means the branch is diverged from '<upstream>'
	$git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
		Enable alias "git lg" to show a more readable git log
